# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What does calling super do in a class?

Your answer: Super is a method that when used within a class allows subclasses to inherit data from an associated superclass. 

Researched answer: Invoking super within a subclass causes ruby to use the initialize function of the parent class. 

2. What is a gem?

Your answer: A user generated module for ruby that can be downloaded to expand built in functionality for the programming language, similar to nodes in REACT.

Researched answer: A community-developed bit of common code functionality. They are managed by the package manager RubyGems.

3. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: A relational database is organized in rows and columns of corresponding data, similar to an excel spreadsheet. I'm unsure on other types of databases at the moment, but would be happy to research it and get back to you with a satisfying answer soon.

Researched answer: Relational databases store data points that are related to each other. There are several different types of databases, including Graph, Operational, and NoSQL.

4. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

Your answer: They are unique identifiers associated with each individual object in a database. This can be useful to differentiate them when two or more objects are generated with identical data, such as the same name.

Researched answer: In a relational database, primary keys act as a unique identifier for each record and fill their own column in the table.

5. What are the HTTP verbs? What is each verb's corresponding CRUD action?

Your answer: I know CRUD stands for create, read, update, and delete; which are the four actions that any API should be able to perform. However I do not yet have the HTTP verbs memorized, but would be happy to look them up and finish this answer with you soon.

Researched answer: The HTTP verbs include POST, GET, PUT, PATCH and DELETE. POST relates to create, GET to read, PUT and PATCH both to update, and DELETE to, unsurprisingly, delete.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: REST is short for representational state transfer. RESTful routing follows a naming convention to combine and simplify the CRUD actions and HTTP methods.

2. Ruby on Rails: A server-side development framework using the Ruby programming language. 

3. Database migrations: A file in ruby-on-rails that allows you to adjust an already existing database.

4. Params: A hash in ruby on rails that is the collection that acts as a collection of all data received during an HTTP request. (I think? Still very confused on this one, multiple sources saying slightly different things.)

5. ERB: A templating engine that allows you to use HTML and Ruby together to create web pages related to ruby-on-rails databases.
